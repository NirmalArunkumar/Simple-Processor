# Simple-Processor
This a project (Verilog) on creating a processor that can use Assembly/Op Code from the switches of DE1-SOC to doing simple arithmatic and logical processes while accessing RAM and also being able to RE-Write in RAM with the output of the processes. All of this are displayed on the monitor which has a been designed with UI that tells you the stages the processor in and helps see how the processor works.

The Work.v file is the Processor's code

The vga_demo.v is the file for UI which uses FSM and many more for implementation of VGA

This is a project done for ECE241 (Digital Systems).
